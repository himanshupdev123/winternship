<p>Hello everyone, I would like to share my experience of doing the Winter Internship at IIT Ropar, an experience that truly changed the way I look at online learning.</p>

<p>When I first heard about this opportunity, it was mentioned that only students with Top 5% / Elite + Gold certifications in NPTEL courses were eligible to apply. Even though I did not fully meet these criteria, I decided to apply with a small hope. I believed that even impossible opportunities deserve an honest attempt. Later, we were informed that due to the large number of applications, candidates would be shortlisted and selected by the professors.</p>

<p>When we were asked to submit a No Objection Certificate from our college, I realized that many students from my college had also applied. Despite all the doubts and uncertainty, one fine day we received the offer letter, which was both shocking and exciting. Nearly 400 students across India were selected for this internship.</p>

<p>The internship began on 22nd December at 9:00 AM, with full-day Zoom sessions. Initially, I assumed it would be a typical online internship involving lectures, assignments, and a final certificate. However, the very first lecture by Prof. Sudarshan Iyengar Sir completely changed my expectations. His session was deeply motivating and made us eagerly look forward to the daily 9 AM stand-up meetings.</p>

<p>As the days passed, these stand-up sessions became one of the most valuable parts of the internship.</p>

<p>Prof. Sudarshan Iyengar Sir’s stand-ups provided constant motivation and clarity of thought.
Meenakshi Ma’am’s interactions encouraged students to openly share experiences and reflect on their learning journey.
Sakshi Ma’am’s Health Points strategies introduced a unique and engaging way to maintain consistency and discipline throughout the internship.</p>

<p>This internship helped me realize that online learning can be even more effective than offline learning when designed properly. We were trained on the MERN stack using the ViBe platform, where cameras had to be on, lectures were short and focused, and quizzes followed every video. Even a single wrong answer required revisiting the video, ensuring that learning could not be skipped.</p>

<p>Along with the courses, we were given case studies that required applying the learned concepts practically.</p>

<p>Even though only two weeks of the internship have been completed, I have already gained valuable technical knowledge, improved focus, and developed better learning discipline.</p>

<p>This experience taught me that the problem is not online learning—it is how we engage with it.</p>
