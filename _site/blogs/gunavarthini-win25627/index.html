<p>“FROM ENDURING TO EXPERIENCING”:</p>

<p>My internship began on December 2025, and to be honest, I had no clear idea what to expect. This was my first-ever internship, and that too in virtual mode. I stepped in with curiosity, nervousness, and a lot of uncertainty.
The first week was focused on completing a course on the “VIBE platform”. At that stage, my mindset was simple: finish everything before the deadline. I was more concerned about ticking tasks off the list than actually understanding what I was learning. Looking back, I realise this is how many of us begin focused on completion rather than comprehension.
But something slowly started to CHANGE.
As days passed, I began to enjoy the internship. Learning STOPPED feeling like a burden and started feeling meaningful. I began to communicate with my peers, observe discussions, and participate even if silently at first. That shift made a huge difference.</p>

<p>“ONE HONEST TRUTH ABOUT ME”:</p>

<p>I struggled badly with confidence and communication. Seeing others speak freely and confidently was intimidating. At times, I felt left out, almost INVISIBLE. Whenever there was a chance to talk, my mind would panic for no reason at all.
Instead of giving up, I CHOSE to observe.
I watched how my peers expressed their ideas, how they communicated naturally, and how comfortable they were in conversations. Surprisingly, this observation became one of my biggest learning tools. I admired their communication skills and slowly started learning from them not through textbooks, but through real interactions.
At some point, I realised something important:
Instead of just enduring the experience, I had started experiencing it.
That small mindset shift changed everything. The fear didn’t disappear overnight, but it became manageable. I was no longer just surviving the internship I was GROWING through it.</p>

<p>“GRATEFULL FOR VALUABLE OPPORTUNITY”:</p>

<p>I’m genuinely grateful to NPTEL for providing such a valuable opportunity,And to Prof. Sudarshan Iyengar and the team for creating this environment, and to my peers who unknowingly became my teachers. This internship didn’t just teach me technical concepts  it taught me CONFIDENCE,OBSERVATION, and the COURAGE to grow.
This journey reminded me that learning doesn’t always begin with understanding. Sometimes, it begins with simply showing up — and staying.</p>
