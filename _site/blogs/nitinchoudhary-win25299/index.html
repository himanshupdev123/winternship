<p>It all started on December 22nd. I remember looking at the clock—8:45 AM to nearly 7:00 PM. The sheer scale of the day was intimidating. When the goal was announced—completing the MERN stack in such a short time—I’ll be honest: I was scared.</p>

<p>In those early hours, I felt like an observer. Watching others interact confidently with Sudarshan Sir made me feel a bit left out, like everyone else had a secret map I was missing. But that feeling didn’t last long, because the journey was designed to pull me in.</p>

<p>As I dove into the ViBe platform, the MERN course became more than just videos. Nandan Sir’s teaching style turned a daunting stack into something manageable. I even found myself smiling at the small details—like the “Easter egg” Mukund Sir tucked into the Express section. It made the learning feel human, not robotic.</p>

<p>I wasn’t just “watching” code; I was “wrestling” with it. It took me two weeks of persistence, but finishing that course felt like a massive personal victory.</p>

<p>One of the most beautiful aspects of this internship was the culture developed among the students. It wasn’t just about individual progress; it was about the community. I found myself in an environment where everyone was eager to help one another. Whether it was a doubt in the breakout rooms or a bug in a case study, there was always a fellow intern ready to lend a hand. This spirit of “growing together” was awsome.</p>

<h1 id="the-support-system">The Support System</h1>
<p>What kept me going through the intensity wasn’t just the code, but the people:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The Daily Spark: Sakshi Mam’s engaging activities .</li>
  <li>The Safety Net: Whenever I felt stuck, the support from Jinal Mam and Nitin Sir made the hurdles feel smaller.</li>
  <li>The Direction: Sudarshan Sir’s daily motivation and Meenakshi Mam’s guidance helped me see the bigger picture—that this wasn’t just about learning a framework, but about building a developer’s mindset.</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="my-takeaway">My Takeaway</h1>
<p>Looking back at that first day on December 22nd, I realize that the “scare” was necessary. Being “left out” was just a temporary phase before I stepped into the flow. I’m walking away from this not just with a certificate, but with the knowledge that I can tackle a massive challenge if I just stay consistent and lean into the community around me.</p>
