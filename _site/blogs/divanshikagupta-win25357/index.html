<p>When I first received the opportunity to intern with the team at <strong>IIT Ropar</strong>, I felt genuinely overwhelmed. Working under the guidance of Sudarshan sir and the VLED team was something I had never expected. I did not imagine that this internship would turn out to be so informative, engaging, and filled with learning at every step.</p>

<p>What truly made this experience special was the way learning was integrated into everything we did. Every morning stand-up call felt refreshing and exciting. The mentors always had something new planned for us be it interactive quizzes designed in impressive ways, thought-provoking topics to brainstorm, or insightful discussions that stayed with me even after the sessions ended. It genuinely felt like fun blended with learning.</p>

<p>The breakout sessions played a major role in shaping my experience. They encouraged learning through peers and helped me step out of my comfort zone. <strong>Expressing ideas, listening to different perspectives, and actively participating in discussions made the learning process more meaningful</strong>. Brainstorming together, solving queries, and discussing ideas with people from different backgrounds prepared us well to take on real project work with confidence.</p>

<p>Another aspect I deeply appreciated was the <strong>structured learning approach</strong> first understanding concepts thoroughly and then implementing them through case studies and discussions. The <strong>focus was always on depth of learning rather than just meeting deadlines</strong>. Here, learning mattered more than just completing tasks.</p>

<p>The ViBe platform also contributed significantly to my focus and discipline. It eliminated distractions and ensured that learning was taken seriously. If attention dropped, the video would reset, reinforcing the importance of understanding concepts thoroughly. <strong>Learning with the support of AI truly felt like the future of education</strong>, and the platform handled it exceptionally well.</p>

<p>The mentors were incredibly supportive and proactive. They resolved queries quickly and continuously introduced new activities to keep our minds engaged. Their dedication and quick responses made the learning environment dynamic and motivating.</p>

<p>This internship also helped me <strong>grow professionally</strong> in unexpected ways. My <strong>LinkedIn</strong> profile gained attention, and I was able to build meaningful connections through this opportunity.</p>

<p>One lesson that stayed with me throughout the internship was <strong>Sudarshan sir’s constant emphasis on focusing on learning rather than running behind deadlines</strong>. That mindset changed how I approach work and learning. Every day, I woke up thinking about what new thing I would learn next.</p>

<p>The encouragement through <strong>health points</strong> motivated me to give my best effort consistently. In just a few weeks, this internship pushed me out of my comfort zone and helped me move toward genuine professional growth.</p>

<p>In just 2 weeks at this internship I have realised that this experience was not about finishing fast , it was about learning deeply.<br />
And that made all the difference.</p>
