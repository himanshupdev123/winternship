<h4 id="writing-a-blog-as-part-of-your-nptel-internship-journey-with-vled-lab"><strong>Writing a Blog as Part of Your NPTEL Internship Journey with VLED Lab</strong></h4>
<p><small><em>(Activity: Call for Blogs)</em></small></p>

<p><img src="../Blog_image.jpg" alt="Blog Writing" style="width: 100%; max-width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; display: block;" /></p>

<p>As part of your internship with the <strong>VLED Lab</strong>, we are opening a <strong>Call for Blogs</strong>—an invitation for you to pause, reflect, and put your journey into words. This activity is not about technical writing skills or perfect grammar. It is about <strong>capturing your experience honestly</strong>, in your own voice, as you lived through this internship.</p>

<h4 id="the-journey"><strong>The Journey</strong></h4>

<p>This internship has been intentionally designed as a learning journey rather than a checklist. You began with a fully hands-on <strong>MERN stack course delivered through ViBe</strong>, where learning happened through practice and persistence. You then moved into solving <strong>case studies</strong>, which required you to think, reason, and struggle like a developer. This was followed by a <strong>viva</strong>, where your understanding and clarity were tested through conversation rather than code alone. For those who cleared the viva, the journey extended further—into <strong>real project work alongside our developers</strong>, where learning became responsibility.
Along the way, many experiences quietly shaped you. Learning on ViBe, submitting code regularly, navigating case studies, attending sessions consistently, discussing ideas in breakout rooms, preparing for the viva, receiving feedback, and working in teams—each of these meant something different to each of you. That difference is what makes your story worth telling.
To help you reflect, you may think about experiences such as learning through ViBe, working through the MERN course, solving case studies, handling coding submissions, participating in breakout room discussions, understanding the role of attendance and consistency, facing the viva, or contributing to real projects. These are only prompts to help you remember. Do not pick any of these as your blog topic directly. Writing on the “easiest” idea is not the goal. Writing from your heart is.</p>

<p>What we are <strong>not looking for</strong> is a summary of the internship or a step-by-step description of what happened.</p>

<p>What we <strong>are looking for</strong> is your lived experience—your doubts, your growth, your surprises, and your takeaways. Write about what stayed with you after the sessions ended. Write about moments that changed how you think or learn. Write as if you are speaking to someone who has never experienced learning in this way.</p>

<h4 id="review-feedback-and-publication"><strong>Review, Feedback, and Publication</strong></h4>

<p>All submitted blogs will be <strong>reviewed by the VLED Lab team</strong>. You will receive <strong>comments and suggestions to help you improve your writing and clarity</strong>. This is part of the learning process—we see writing as something that evolves through feedback, just like code.</p>

<p>Blogs that are selected after review will be <strong>published on the Winternship website under the Blogs section</strong>. Additionally, <strong>selected blogs will be recognised for their</strong> thoughtful reflection, originality, and authenticity.</p>

<h4 id="submission-instructions"><strong>Submission Instructions</strong></h4>

<p>You are first required to publish your blog on your LinkedIn under the <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/article/new/" target="_blank">Article</a> section and then you are required to submit your blog as <strong>Markdown file</strong> to <strong>Winternship</strong> GitHub repository as a new pull request. Your blog will be rendered as a webpage, so ensure it is readable, well-structured, and personal. Follow the folder structure, naming conventions, and file structure provided below. Each blog must be written individually and should reflect your own journey.</p>

        <p>I didn’t expect the first two weeks of this internship to leave such a lasting impression - but they quietly did.</p>

<p>Somewhere between attending sessions and learning from the ViBe portal, I began noticing small shifts in how I approach learning. Nothing dramatic, just subtle changes that stayed with me even after the sessions ended.</p>

<p>This internship goes beyond just technical knowledge. Along the way, ideas like <strong>collaboration</strong>, <strong>communication</strong>, and <strong>consistency</strong> started to feel just as important.</p>

<p><strong>Learning felt less like an individual task and more like a shared experience - something that grows better when done together.</strong></p>

<p>One of the earliest changes I noticed was in my daily routine. I was never someone who could comfortably wake up early, but over time, starting the day earlier stopped feeling difficult. The 8:45 stand-up meetings quickly became a steady, comforting way to start my mornings, accompanied by motivation and encouragement from Sudarshan Sir and Meenakshi Ma’am - setting a calm, positive tone for the day ahead.</p>

<p>The best part is how self-paced and pressure-free everything is. We are allowed to take time to understand concepts, ask questions, and focus on learning - not just finishing tasks.</p>

<p>Certain sessions stood out more than others. Creating dashboards from Google Sheets with Sakshi Ma’am showed how effective simple tools can be when explained clearly. The GitHub and React hands-on session by Nandan Sir made learning feel practical and approachable. These moments made learning engaging and enjoyable.</p>

<p>What truly holds this experience together are the people. The team is patient and supportive, and learning feels open and welcoming. The fellow interns are always ready to help, respond, and encourage each other whether through LinkedIn or the Cliq channel. This sense of collaboration makes learning feel lighter and more joyful.</p>

<p>I am grateful to be a part of <strong>NPTEL’s Winter Internship</strong> and thankful for the opportunity to learn in such a thoughtfully designed space. My sincere thanks to <strong>IIT Ropar</strong> and <strong>Sudarshan Sir</strong> for taking us in and creating an environment where learning feels meaningful and motivating.</p>

<p>As this journey continues, I find myself carrying these lessons beyond the sessions - not just in <strong>what</strong> I’m learning, but in <strong>how</strong> I learn. I’m looking forward to the weeks ahead and can’t wait to see what more this internship has in store!

        <p>This internship began for me even before the first session started.</p>

<p>I still remember how excited I felt when I received the NOC from my college. That excitement came with relief and gratitude, especially towards my college and our Principal Madam, who took the initiative to make this internship possible for me. On the very first day of the internship, I had my end-semester practical examination. Without that support, I would not have been able to attend the inaugural session at all. That moment itself made this journey feel important and personal.</p>

<p>This is my <strong>first internship</strong>, and I came into it with no prior experience. Naturally, I was nervous. Not the kind of nervousness that disappears after introductions, but the quiet kind — wondering whether I would be able to keep up, whether I was learning “fast enough,” and whether I truly belonged here.</p>

<p>The learning on the <strong>ViBe platform</strong> taught me something unexpected: learning does not always have to be fast to be real. In the beginning, I watched the videos slowly. Sometimes I paused, replayed, and questioned myself more than the content. At times, it felt like others were moving ahead while I was still trying to understand the basics. But gradually, something shifted. Concepts started connecting. Things that once felt heavy began to feel familiar. Without realizing it, I had improved.</p>

<p>The case studies were another turning point. They were not about getting the “right answer” immediately. They demanded patience, reasoning, and the ability to sit with uncertainty. I struggled, but I also learned how to think instead of just follow steps. Completing them within the given timeline gave me confidence — not because they were perfect, but because I finished something I once doubted I could.</p>

<p>What stayed with me throughout this journey was the emphasis on <strong>consistency</strong>. Attendance, regular submissions, discussions, and feedback — none of these felt optional. Slowly, I began to understand why. Learning here was not treated as an event, but as a habit.</p>

<p>Now, as I continue this internship, I feel different from how I started. I am more focused, more serious, and more aware of how I learn. I no longer rush through content just to complete it. I value understanding over speed.</p>

<p>I am grateful to all the professors, mentors, and peers who guided me continuously and created an environment where learning felt challenging but supportive. I truly hope to complete this internship on a positive note and carry these lessons beyond these weeks.</p>

<p>This journey did not just teach me tools or technologies.<br />
It taught me patience, confidence, and trust in my own pace of growth.</p>

        # My Internship Journey: Transforming Procrastination Into Progress

This internship has been a highly rewarding experience that supported my growth on personal, academic, and professional levels. Beyond strengthening my technical skills, it helped me develop a structured mindset and adopt a more disciplined and professional approach to learning and work.

At the beginning of the internship, my exposure to Express.js and React was limited, and these technologies initially felt challenging. However, the focused, bite-sized learning format provided through the ViBe platform made the journey engaging and manageable. The concise modules encouraged daily learning, improved consistency, and enabled me to successfully complete 100% of my ViBe learning progress with confidence. Instant feedback, visible progress, and small milestones created a healthy dopamine-driven motivation, making learning feel rewarding and achievable rather than overwhelming.

One of the most meaningful transformations during this journey was overcoming procrastination and significantly reducing doom scrolling. Real-time progress tracking and rank updates helped me stay focused and replace unproductive habits with intentional learning. Breakout rooms, daily stand-ups, and interactive Zoom sessions further enriched the experience by encouraging discussions, idea exchange, and learning from diverse perspectives.

Overall, this internship helped me shift from outcome-driven pressure to curiosity-driven, consistent learning. It reinforced the importance of focus, attention to detail, collaboration, and continuous improvement. I am excited to apply my learning to real-world projects and continue growing through hands-on development.

        <h1 id="my-nptel-winter-internship-experience">My NPTEL WINTER INTERNSHIP EXPERIENCE</h1>

<h2 id="chilakamarri-krishna">Chilakamarri Krishna</h2>

<p>When I was in my III BTech II Semester, one of my professors named Abdul S Kani suggested me and my friends to write the NPTEL Examination. At first, we were reluctant and thought about the 1000₹ we needed to spend and the amount of work I had to do to finish the weekly assignments and listen to NPTEL classes along with my college work.</p>

<p>But one fine day, we decided to go for it and applied for the NPTEL Programming in Java exam. To be honest, I did not listen to classes daily. I used to listen to classes every Sunday all at once and submit the assignment on the same day.</p>

<p>At last, the day arrived to give the NPTEL Java exam. My five other friends and I prepared so much for the exam, and after coming out of the exam hall, our faces were filled with happiness and pride that we could do the NPTEL exam well. When the results arrived, I was shocked and happy at the same time. I got 95% in Java and was in the Topper 5% and Elite + Gold category. My five other friends were also in the Elite + Gold category.</p>

<p>The same professor suggested us to apply for the NPTEL Winter Internship, which I had not heard of until that day. We applied for the internship under the guidance of Professor Sudarshan Iyengar and had little to no hope that I would get selected. But one fine day, I got an email that I was selected for the internship.</p>

<h1 id="my-experience-during-internship">My Experience during Internship</h1>

<p>The internship started on 22 December 2025 at 9:00 AM in the morning. I had no clue about what would happen, what to do, or what to learn to keep up the pace during the internship. But the very first Zoom meeting gave me enough confidence that I could manage to sail through the internship if I put in adequate effort.</p>

<p>I would wake up early in the morning every day, eagerly waiting for the Zoom meeting to start and listening to the motivation provided by Sudarshan Iyengar sir and Meenakshi ma’am. Until that very first Zoom meeting, I had no idea that Zoom had so many features.</p>

<p>During each meeting, I carefully and curiously listened to each and every word of Sudarshan sir. I learned many things during this internship. One of them was realizing that I can eat two chapathis within 3 minutes by turning off the video and carefully listening to the meeting, while being afraid that Sudarshan sir might ask why my video was off.</p>

<p>I was very eager and enthusiastic to speak every day in the meeting, and I wanted to be known to Sudarshan sir in a good way (not in a bad way).</p>

<p>Many great ideas were implemented by all the team members of the internship to ensure maximum attendance and maximum learning.</p>

<p>To be honest, until Sakshi Sharma ma’am showed us the capabilities of Google Sheets, I used to think of Google Sheets as a piece of trash.</p>

<h1 id="things-i-got-to-know-during-the-internship">Things I Got to Know during the Internship</h1>

<ul>
  <li>Zoom features</li>
  <li>Google Sheets features</li>
  <li>How to effectively use LinkedIn (which I used more in these ten days than I did in my four years of BTech)</li>
  <li>How to consistently learn the MERN stack and complete 100% progress in three days</li>
  <li>About Zoho Cliq</li>
  <li>Attendance automation</li>
</ul>

<p>After every session, my motivation reached a peak until I started feeling hungry, closed the laptop, and went to eat. But when I started doing the case studies, especially during React, my frustration also reached a peak, and at one point I wanted to throw away my laptop. Then I remembered that ChatGPT could save my laptop from being thrown away by explaining the case studies to me.</p>

<p>Honestly, for some case studies, I asked ChatGPT to explain them to me as if it were explaining to a donkey. It simplified everything as much as possible.</p>

<p>I have now finished my case studies, and my heart feels lighter, as if a heavy stone has been removed from my head. Now I am excited to work on a real-time project.</p>

<p>When I wanted to talk during Zoom sessions, a few things stopped me:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Sometimes the microphone felt like it was possessed by a devil</li>
  <li>Sometimes my fear stopped me from talking</li>
  <li>Another fear was health points deduction</li>
</ul>

<p>But most of the time, I spoke with Sudarshan sir, and I believe that he at least knows my name when he sees the participants list. I truly hope that I give my best for the project and make everyone remember me.</p>

<p>Yours sincerely,
Chilakamarri Krishna Panchajanya</p>

<p>When I first received the opportunity to intern with the team at <strong>IIT Ropar</strong>, I felt genuinely overwhelmed. Working under the guidance of Sudarshan sir and the VLED team was something I had never expected. I did not imagine that this internship would turn out to be so informative, engaging, and filled with learning at every step.</p>

<p>What truly made this experience special was the way learning was integrated into everything we did. Every morning stand-up call felt refreshing and exciting. The mentors always had something new planned for us be it interactive quizzes designed in impressive ways, thought-provoking topics to brainstorm, or insightful discussions that stayed with me even after the sessions ended. It genuinely felt like fun blended with learning.</p>

<p>The breakout sessions played a major role in shaping my experience. They encouraged learning through peers and helped me step out of my comfort zone. <strong>Expressing ideas, listening to different perspectives, and actively participating in discussions made the learning process more meaningful</strong>. Brainstorming together, solving queries, and discussing ideas with people from different backgrounds prepared us well to take on real project work with confidence.</p>

<p>Another aspect I deeply appreciated was the <strong>structured learning approach</strong> first understanding concepts thoroughly and then implementing them through case studies and discussions. The <strong>focus was always on depth of learning rather than just meeting deadlines</strong>. Here, learning mattered more than just completing tasks.</p>

<p>The ViBe platform also contributed significantly to my focus and discipline. It eliminated distractions and ensured that learning was taken seriously. If attention dropped, the video would reset, reinforcing the importance of understanding concepts thoroughly. <strong>Learning with the support of AI truly felt like the future of education</strong>, and the platform handled it exceptionally well.</p>

<p>The mentors were incredibly supportive and proactive. They resolved queries quickly and continuously introduced new activities to keep our minds engaged. Their dedication and quick responses made the learning environment dynamic and motivating.</p>

<p>This internship also helped me <strong>grow professionally</strong> in unexpected ways. My <strong>LinkedIn</strong> profile gained attention, and I was able to build meaningful connections through this opportunity.</p>

<p>One lesson that stayed with me throughout the internship was <strong>Sudarshan sir’s constant emphasis on focusing on learning rather than running behind deadlines</strong>. That mindset changed how I approach work and learning. Every day, I woke up thinking about what new thing I would learn next.</p>

<p>The encouragement through <strong>health points</strong> motivated me to give my best effort consistently. In just a few weeks, this internship pushed me out of my comfort zone and helped me move toward genuine professional growth.</p>

<p>In just 2 weeks at this internship I have realised that this experience was not about finishing fast , it was about learning deeply.<br />
And that made all the difference.</p>

<h2 id="a-nervous-start">A Nervous Start</h2>
<p>On the first day of my first internship, the schedule was from 9 AM to 6 PM continuously, with only a few short breaks. I was honestly scared after seeing the timings. But as the days passed, I realized that instead of losing time, I was actually finding myself. I finally understood where I was standing, what I was lacking, and how I could improve.</p>

<h2 id="learning-by-doing">Learning by Doing</h2>
<p>Learning here does not stop with watching videos. After completing the modules, we move into hands-on case studies, where real thinking and problem-solving begin. This was the first time I experienced learning that truly challenged me, and it made me feel like I was slowly becoming a real developer, not just a student. At that moment, I realized this was not going to be just an internship.</p>

<h2 id="morning-mentorship">Morning Mentorship</h2>
<p>Every day at 9 AM during the stand-up sessions, I see our teachers — Professor Sudarshan Iyengar Sir, Meenakshi Ma’am, Sakshi Ma’am, Bhavna Ma’am, Harshadeep Ma’am, Jinal Gupta Ma’am, and Nitin Shankar Sir — bringing such positive energy. The way Meenakshi Ma’am starts the day with a smile fills me with the same positivity. The session by Sudarshan Sir always boosts motivation, gives good direction, and reminds me why I chose this field. The fellow interns make each session more interesting and lively. The way Nandhan Sir explained the ViBe course, along with the extra sessions he takes, helped us learn beyond expectations. The session by Sakshi Ma’am was especially interesting because it taught us much more than just MERN.</p>

<h2 id="two-week-change">Two-Week Change</h2>
<p>We have completed only two weeks of the internship, and in this short time I have learned so much. Life before the internship and life after the internship are not the same. Every single day gives me a new chance to change, to grow, and to become better. I stopped doom scrolling, I started waking up early so I would never miss the 9 AM stand-up, and I now try to improve myself a little more every day. These small habits make me proud, especially because this is my very first internship.</p>

<h2 id="a-dream-fulfilled-and-gratitude">A Dream Fulfilled and Gratitude</h2>
<p>Overall, this experience has been truly life-changing. It transformed the way I think, study, and focus. Studying in an IIT has always been a dream for me, and in this form, through this internship, I feel that dream has been fulfilled. As my first internship, this journey will always remain special to me. Above all, I feel deep gratitude and thankfulness toward all the teachers who work so hard for our growth, not just as developers, but as individuals.</p>

        <h2 id="my-internship-journey-from-uncertainty-to-confidence-in-learning-mern">My Internship Journey: From Uncertainty to Confidence in Learning MERN</h2>

<p>When I began this internship, I was completely focused on learning Java full-stack development, and transitioning to the MERN stack initially felt challenging. The tools, concepts, and development approach were different from what I was used to, which made me feel uncertain about my abilities. I did not have complete confidence or clarity about my skills in MERN. What I did have, however, was curiosity and a strong willingness to learn. At the start, I was unsure about what to expect or whether I would be able to keep up, but as the days progressed, the learning journey helped me gradually find my footing.</p>

<p>The learning approach felt unfamiliar at first. Instead of long and overwhelming sessions, the content was delivered in short, focused modules on the ViBe learning platform. This structure helped me stay attentive and prevented burnout. After each video, there was a quiz, and completing these quizzes gave me a small yet meaningful sense of achievement. This steady rhythm kept me motivated—it felt less like passively consuming content and more like actively participating in the learning process.</p>

<p>As the internship progressed, learning moved beyond videos into hands-on case studies. These case studies were thoughtfully designed to bridge the gap between theory and real-world application. They introduced practical scenarios across modern web development technologies, requiring deeper thinking and problem-solving. Working on them helped me understand how different concepts connect and function together in real situations.</p>

<h3 id="what-the-case-studies-helped-me-with">What the Case Studies Helped Me With</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Apply concepts instead of merely recalling them</li>
  <li>Connect ideas in a logical and structured way</li>
  <li>Strengthen my problem-solving and analytical thinking</li>
</ul>

<p>Another important part of this internship experience was the daily stand-up sessions. I made it a habit to attend these sessions every day at sharp 9:00 AM, turning on my video—not because it was mandatory, but out of genuine interest and excitement to be part of the discussion. These sessions created a sense of discipline, connection, and motivation to stay consistent in my learning.</p>

<p>Professor Sudarshan Iyengar Sir played a key role in shaping the overall learning experience through his guidance and vision. Along with him, Meenakshi Ma’am, Sakshi Ma’am, Bhavna Ma’am, Harshadeep Ma’am, Jinal Gupta Ma’am, and Nitin Sankar Sir contributed significantly to making the sessions engaging and interactive. They frequently conducted live polls, quizzes, and interactive activities during Zoom sessions and also introduced us to concepts beyond the regular curriculum. These interactions made the learning environment lively and encouraged active participation.</p>

<p>A special mention goes to Nandan Prabhudesai Sir, who taught us the MERN stack through the ViBe platform. His sessions helped me clearly understand core MERN concepts and how different parts of the stack work together. The GitHub and React sessions conducted by him were especially helpful in building practical understanding and confidence. Because of his teaching approach, learning MERN felt structured, approachable, and meaningful.</p>

<p>One moment that particularly stood out during a Zoom session was when Sakshi Ma’am explained how our internship progress is automated using scripts that directly update data in Google Sheets. The explanation was simple yet impactful. It clearly demonstrated how programming can be used to automate everyday processes and how even small ideas can create meaningful and practical solutions.</p>

<p>The breakout room discussions added another valuable layer to my learning experience. Collaborating with peers while solving case studies exposed me to multiple perspectives. Listening to others explain their thought processes often helped me gain better clarity on concepts and identify gaps in my own understanding.</p>

<h3 id="key-takeaways-from-discussions">Key Takeaways from Discussions</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Learning becomes stronger when shared</li>
  <li>Different viewpoints deepen understanding</li>
  <li>Collaboration builds confidence and clarity</li>
</ul>

<p>Overall, this internship taught me that learning does not happen all at once. It is a gradual process built through consistent engagement, practical application, discussion, and reflection. While I am still learning, I now approach new concepts with far more confidence and curiosity than when I first started. This journey has not only strengthened my technical skills but has also reshaped the way I view learning itself.</p>

        <p>It all started on December 22nd. I remember looking at the clock—8:45 AM to nearly 7:00 PM. The sheer scale of the day was intimidating. When the goal was announced—completing the MERN stack in such a short time—I’ll be honest: I was scared.</p>

<p>In those early hours, I felt like an observer. Watching others interact confidently with Sudarshan Sir made me feel a bit left out, like everyone else had a secret map I was missing. But that feeling didn’t last long, because the journey was designed to pull me in.</p>

<h1 id="beyond-the-tutorials-easter-eggs-and-case-studies">Beyond the Tutorials: Easter Eggs and Case Studies</h1>
<p>As I dove into the ViBe platform, the MERN course became more than just videos. Nandan Sir’s teaching style turned a daunting stack into something manageable. I even found myself smiling at the small details—like the “Easter egg” Mukund Sir tucked into the Express section. It made the learning feel human, not robotic.</p>

<p>I wasn’t just “watching” code; I was “wrestling” with it. It took me two weeks of persistence, but finishing that course felt like a massive personal victory.</p>

<h1 id="a-culture-of-collaboration">A Culture of Collaboration</h1>
<p>One of the most beautiful aspects of this internship was the culture developed among the students. It wasn’t just about individual progress; it was about the community. I found myself in an environment where everyone was eager to help one another. Whether it was a doubt in the breakout rooms or a bug in a case study, there was always a fellow intern ready to lend a hand. This spirit of “growing together” was awsome.</p>

<h1 id="the-support-system">The Support System</h1>
<p>What kept me going through the intensity wasn’t just the code, but the people:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The Daily Spark: Sakshi Mam’s engaging activities .</li>
  <li>The Safety Net: Whenever I felt stuck, the support from Jinal Mam and Nitin Sir made the hurdles feel smaller.</li>
  <li>The Direction: Sudarshan Sir’s daily motivation and Meenakshi Mam’s guidance helped me see the bigger picture—that this wasn’t just about learning a framework, but about building a developer’s mindset.</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="my-takeaway">My Takeaway</h1>
<p>Looking back at that first day on December 22nd, I realize that the “scare” was necessary. Being “left out” was just a temporary phase before I stepped into the flow. I’m walking away from this not just with a certificate, but with the knowledge that I can tackle a massive challenge if I just stay consistent and lean into the community around me.</p>

<p>I logged into my <strong>IIT Ropar</strong> internship expecting lessons. What I didn’t expect was a quiet upgrade to my thinking software.</p>

<p>Two weeks in, this experience has turned out to be far more meaningful than a checklist of tasks or outcomes. What stands out is not a single assignment, but the way this internship subtly reshapes how problems are approached and questions are framed.</p>

<p>A core part of the journey has been the <strong>daily meetings and Zoom breakout rooms</strong>, where interns collaborate on case studies, brainstorm ideas, and challenge assumptions together. These sessions feel less like meetings and more like idea gyms where thinking is exercised and perspectives evolve. Even in a virtual setup, a strong sense of connection exists, strengthened by all interns being linked through <strong>LinkedIn</strong>, turning peers into an active professional network.</p>

<p>Building <strong>MERN stack codes from scratch</strong> reinforces the value of fundamentals, patience, and clarity. The quizzes are high-dopamine and oddly addictive, while the <strong>ViBe course</strong> delivers short, sharp, YouTube-Shorts–style content that makes learning feel effortless.</p>

<p>Above all, this internship values <strong>depth over speed</strong>. Credit goes to the organizing team for designing an experience that feels intentional, engaging, and genuinely enjoyable.</p>

<p>Two weeks in, comfort zones are shrinking, curiosity is growing and that feels like exactly the point.</p>

<h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>

<p>This internship taught me a very important lesson: <strong>even if we have the right skill set, our work is not impactful if we do not show it or communicate it properly</strong>. Skills alone are not enough. Opening up, communicating, and networking are equally important.</p>

<p>Through this experience, I clearly understood how crucial it is to express our ideas, share our work, and connect with people. Networking is not optional anymore it plays a key role in personal and professional growth.</p>

<h3 id="being-active-and-exploring-new-initiatives">Being Active and Exploring New Initiatives</h3>

<p>During this internship, I was active on LinkedIn and started exploring different projects and initiatives. One such project that really stood out to me was <strong>Annam.ai</strong>, which is a great initiative by the Indian government and the IITs to explore how AI can be implemented in real-world scenarios.</p>

<p>Before this, most of what I heard about AI was negative — things like <em>AI will replace jobs</em>, <em>AI will do everything</em>, and similar fears. But after exploring projects like Annam.ai and others, my perspective completely changed.</p>

<h3 id="understanding-the-real-purpose-of-ai">Understanding the Real Purpose of AI</h3>

<p>I realized that <strong>AI is not about replacing humans</strong>. Instead, it is about how we can use AI to improve development and productivity. It is about how we can implement AI in our daily lives and in key sectors of our country such as <strong>education, health, and agriculture</strong>, to make our country more developed and to improve the lifestyle and sustainability of people.</p>

<p>One thing I can now surely confirm through this experience is that <strong>AI will not dominate or damage our lives</strong>. It is here to improve productivity, and it is our responsibility to implement it properly and adapt ourselves to it.</p>

<h3 id="learning-from-simple-yet-powerful-ideas">Learning from Simple Yet Powerful Ideas</h3>

<p>I also came across a few posts by <strong>Sudarshan sir</strong>, and one particular post included a stand-up comedy video that highlighted the <strong>overuse and unnecessary over-implementation of technology in daily life</strong>. That post made me reflect on how we often try to solve every problem using complex technical solutions, even when simpler approaches can be more effective. From this, I learned that we should not always think in an overly technical or complicated way.</p>

<p>Sometimes, what we really need is <strong>first-principles thinking</strong>.</p>

<p>For example, when we hear that initiatives like <strong>Annam.ai</strong> and the government are investing around <strong>₹300 crore in AI for agriculture</strong>, most of us immediately imagine advanced and futuristic technologies such as detection models, heavy data analysis, and complex AI pipelines. While these approaches are important and will certainly be implemented, what impressed me the most was their focus on simple yet highly impactful ideas.</p>

<p>One such project under Annam.ai uses managed honey <strong>beehives</strong>. By placing beehives in and around crop fields, bees systematically visit flowers and carry out effective pollination. This managed pollination significantly increases the percentage of flowers that turn into fruits or seeds, leading to massive improvements in yield in some cases up to 152% higher. Along with increased crop production, the same bees also produce honey and pollen, giving farmers additional sources of income and making the solution both economically beneficial and sustainable.</p>

<p>This clearly shows that even without implementing complex AI algorithms, a simple and well-thought-out intervention can create an enormous impact. Sometimes, basic steps, when applied in the right way, can outperform even the most advanced technological solutions.</p>

<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>

<p>This experience taught me that <strong>impact does not always come from advanced technology alone</strong>. Sometimes, simple ideas implemented in the right way can create huge change. We should learn to think differently and not always jump directly to advanced technical solutions.</p>

<p>Overall, this internship helped me grow not just technically, but also in terms of mindset, communication, networking, and understanding the real role of technology especially AI in shaping a better future.</p>

  <p><em>“Gratitude opens the door. Responsibility decides how far you walk.”</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Before joining this winter internship, the first emotion I felt was <strong>gratitude</strong>.<br />
Being selected itself felt like recognition  a quiet validation of effort, patience, and persistence. At that moment, I wasn’t thinking about outcomes or certificates. I was simply thankful for the opportunity to be here.</p>

<p>But once the internship actually began, that feeling evolved.</p>

<p>Gratitude slowly transformed into <strong>responsibility</strong>.</p>

<p>Responsibility to show up.<br />
Responsibility to stay consistent.<br />
Responsibility to carry myself not just as a learner, but as a contributor.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="-a-shift-in-mindset">🌱 A Shift in Mindset</h2>

<p>This internship didn’t announce its impact loudly.<br />
Instead, it worked silently  upgrading how I think, focus, and engage.</p>

<p>It became clear very early that this was <strong>not a passive experience</strong>.<br />
The structure itself demands intention.</p>

<blockquote>

<h2 id="-learning-on-the-vibe-platform-focus-redefined">🎥 Learning on the ViBe Platform: Focus Redefined</h2>

<p>One of the most distinctive parts of this journey has been learning through the <strong>ViBe platform</strong>.</p>

<p>Unlike traditional online courses, ViBe enforces <strong>deep focus and discipline</strong>:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Computer vision technology ensures attention remains on the screen</li>
  <li>Multitasking and distractions are minimized</li>
  <li>Every video concludes with a <strong>quiz</strong>, reinforcing understanding instantly</li>
</ul>

<p>Initially, this strict focus felt challenging. But over time, I realized:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>“Focus is not forced here  it is trained.”</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The structure transforms learning from passive watching into <strong>active engagement</strong>.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="️-from-watching-to-doing-mern-stack--case-studies">🛠️ From Watching to Doing: MERN Stack &amp; Case Studies</h2>

<p>Learning doesn’t stop at videos. After completing modules, we move into <strong>hands-on case studies</strong>, especially around the <strong>MERN stack</strong>.</p>

<p>These case studies help:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Translate theory into practice</li>
  <li>Strengthen conceptual clarity</li>
  <li>Encourage collaborative problem-solving</li>
</ul>

<p>To support this, interns are grouped into <strong>Zoom breakout rooms</strong>, where discussions feel more like idea labs than meetings.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>“When perspectives meet, understanding deepens.”</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>I actively participated in brainstorming, implementation, and debugging within my group, ensuring I was involved not just in listening, but in <strong>doing</strong>.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="-mentorship-guidance--daily-engagement">🤝 Mentorship, Guidance &amp; Daily Engagement</h2>

<p>Beyond coursework, the <strong>daily Zoom sessions with Sudarshan Iyengar Sir and the mentor team</strong> have been incredibly impactful. These sessions go far beyond assignments, offering valuable insights into:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Career growth paths</li>
  <li>Industry expectations</li>
  <li>Effective learning and thinking strategies</li>
</ul>

<p>The <strong>daily assignments guided by Rohit Sharma Sir and Sakshi Sharma Madam</strong> played a crucial role in solidifying concepts through consistent practical application, ensuring that learning remained structured and progressive.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="-contribution-beyond-the-classroom">🌐 Contribution Beyond the Classroom</h2>

<p>One of the moments I’m most proud of during this internship is contributing beyond my own learning.</p>

<p>I actively helped in:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Compiling structured <strong>case study notes</strong></li>
  <li>Collaborating with peers to build a <strong>website</strong> for easy access to shared learning materials</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>“Learning multiplies when it is shared.”</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>This initiative strengthened both my understanding and my sense of responsibility toward the learning community.</p>

        <h1 id="my-online-internship-experience-at-iit-ropar">My Online Internship Experience at IIT Ropar</h1>

<p>Hello all, I am here to share my genuine and honest experience of my internship. I recently got an opportunity for an internship at IIT Ropar. But one thing that makes me sad is that it is completely online. But you know what? Conducting an online internship makes you more lucky. You might think about this statement, but I will let you know how this is lucky by the end of this blog.</p>

<p>By seeing the offer letter, I thought that it was just a normal internship where you have to learn from some sources and then start working on a project, and when you are finally done with that project, you will receive the certificate. But this is not like that. Being a final-year student, managing all the things might be very difficult.</p>

<p>On the first day of the internship, the timings were 9 am to 6 pm continuously, with some short breaks. So, I was really afraid of these timings and felt very sad, thinking that I would not have time for my self-preparation.</p>

<p>On the first day, I met Professor Sudarshan Iyengar sir. He inaugurated the session, and he is one of my favorite professors because when I visited IIT Madras, he taught us a lecture which was very interesting. After the class, I wished to talk to the sir, but it was not fulfilled. I am thinking about how lucky I was again, being selected for the internship under the same professor.</p>

<p>Initially, they said to complete some modern courses on the Y platform, which was really challenging, but the experience was amazing. It is not like the other platforms. It aims in a way that the student should be focused and not get distracted. After that, they gave case studies on each topic, which really improved my practical knowledge in the topics, because just listening to the courses can give you only half knowledge without practicing anything.</p>

<p>We have completed only two weeks of the internship. You know what, in these two weeks, I have learned a lot. It not only improved my subject knowledge, but it also improved my daily routine and my focus. Life before and after the internship is not the same; it is completely different.</p>

<p>I am attending the daily stand-ups at sharp 9 am and turning on our videos, not because of their orders, but because of my pure interest and excitement to join the session. Our teachers—Professor Sudarshan Iyengar Sir, Meenakshi Ma’am, Sakshi Ma’am, Bhavna Ma’am, Harshadeep Ma’am, Jinal Gupta Ma’am, Nitin Shankar Sir—and last but not the least, the fellow interns, make these sessions much more interesting day by day. They are coming up with more interesting activities. They conduct polls during the Zoom sessions, conduct quizzes, and also conduct sessions on learning new things.</p>

<p>The most important thing I want to mention is about my fellow interns. We got the chance to interact with diverse people with diverse mindsets all over India. We have connected through LinkedIn, and we all improved our networking. The most lovely thing is that we have the opportunity to discuss, learn, share our knowledge, and debug our problems or code. All this happened with the help of breakout rooms. I have learned a lot by discussing with them and knowing new things. You might wonder that we have discussions up to 2 am at midnight.</p>

<p>Overall, the learning experience is very, very good. It completely changed the way I think and focus. Actually, studying in an IIT is a dream for me, and I think it was fulfilled in this way. But it is very sad that only two weeks are left. But we can’t change it, right? I hope the interactions with our fellow interns will continue for sure.</p>

<p>One thing I forgot is that if the internship is offline, we do not have the opportunity to interact with the sir all the time, and with all the teachers who were very soft, very sweet, and very kind-hearted. Also, you do not have the option of late-night discussions like breakout rooms.</p>

<p>I really want to express my utmost gratitude and thankfulness to all the teachers who are working hard for our sake. I want to say, don’t lose this opportunity. I really recommend joining this internship. It will change you a lot for sure. If you lose this internship, you can lose a lot for sure. Thank you for the opportunity to express our thoughts in this internship.</p>
